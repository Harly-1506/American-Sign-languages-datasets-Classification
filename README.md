## First Dataset
> The data set is a collection of images of alphabets from the American Sign Language, separated in 29 folders which represent the various classes.


> The training data set contains 87,000 images which are 200x200 pixels. There are 29 classes, of which 26 are for the letters A-Z and 3 classes for SPACE, DELETE and NOTHING.
These 3 classes are very helpful in real-time applications, and classification.
The test data set contains a mere 29 images, to encourage the use of real-world test images.
